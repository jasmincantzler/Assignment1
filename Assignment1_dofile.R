###Usage:women
###Format: A data frame with 15 observations on 2 variables.

###Source: The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1975.

names(women)
# finds variable names (in this case two, "height" and "weight")

# Convert the variables in centimeters and kilograms
women$height_cm<-women$height*2.54
women$weight_kg<-women$weight*0.45359237

colors = c("violet")
# specifies a color
hist(women$height_cm,

# specifies a color
hist(women$weight_kg,
     main='Weight for American Women aged 30-39',
     xlab='weight in kg',
     col=colors)
#creates histogram for the two variables "height" and "weight"
mean(women$weight_kg)
#calculates the mean, average mean weight is 136.73 lbs (62.02kg)
mean(women$height_cm)
#calculates the mean, average mean height is 65 in (165.1 cm)
median(women$weight_kg)
# median weight 135
median(women$height_cm)
# median height 165.1
range(women$weight_kg)
# calculates the range, 52,16kg - 74,39kg
range(women$height_cm)
# calculates the range, 147,32 cm to 182,88 cm
plot(women$height_cm, women$weight_kg,
    main='Average Height and Weight for American Women aged 30-39',
    xlab='weight in kg',
    ylab='height in cm')
cor.test(women$weight_kg, women$height_cm)
#weight and height are positively correlated
